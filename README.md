## Features Overview

- **Custom length** — choose exactly how many characters your password will have
- **Uppercase letters** — optionally include A–Z characters
- **Digits** — optionally include 0–9
- **Special characters** — optionally include punctuation symbols (e.g. `!@#$%`)
- **Guaranteed inclusion** — if you enable a character type, at least one of that type is guaranteed to appear in the output
- **Shuffled output** — the final password is shuffled so guaranteed characters don't appear in a predictable position
- **Input validation** — raises an error if the requested password length is too short to fit all the enabled character types


## Installation
To install this program, use the commands below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fmax-dev/PASSWORD-GENERATOR.git
cd PASSWORD-GENERATOR
```

No external dependencies are required — the program uses only Python's standard library (`random` and `string`).


## Usage
To start using this program:

1. Clone this repo using the commands above
2. Run the program:
    - Windows: `python password_generator.py`

3. Answer the prompts:
    - Enter your desired password length
    - Choose whether to include uppercase letters (`y`/`n`)
    - Choose whether to include digits (`y`/`n`)
    - Choose whether to include special characters (`y`/`n`)

## Next Steps

Looking to expand the project? Here are a few potential improvements for future versions:

- **Multiple passwords** — generate a batch of N passwords in one run
- **Copy to clipboard** — automatically copy the result so it's ready to paste
- **Password strength indicator** — rate the generated password's entropy
- **Save to file** — optionally append generated passwords to a local file
- **GUI / web interface** — a browser or desktop UI for non-technical users
- **Exclude ambiguous characters** — option to omit characters like `0`, `O`, `l`, `1` that are easy to confuse
